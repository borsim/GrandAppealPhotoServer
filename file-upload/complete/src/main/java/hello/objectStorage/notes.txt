NOTE:- this will not work on you computer immediately.

To get it to work you will need to set up a config file and and RSA key pair.
How to do this:

Currently I am hard coding the name of the image I wanna upload.
We will have to change this so that it is automated.

Additonally I am hard coding the name of the file as it will be in the OS.
If you upload a different image with this name it will override.
We will also have to incrememnt some sort of naming/numbering.
(maybe if the API for the app autonumbers them, just steal the original name?)
